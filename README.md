I'm a software development "hobbyist" from Toronto, Canada. I'm a **Director** at **Deloitte Canada**, specializing in the Architecture of system-to-system integrations -- especially APIs -- but this GH account is for my personal code.

- ✏ I'm currently working on the **Soul Health Check** (**SoulHX**) app (not yet deployed)
- 📖 I was the primary author of *Beginning XML* (Wrox Press, 1999) for the first four editions
- 🧑‍🏫 As a developer I specialize in React, Express, Bootstrap, and Node in general
- 🎸 Fun facts: I play the guitar
